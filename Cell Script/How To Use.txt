You only need to compile script.cpp in c++11 or higher.

clang++ cellScript.cpp  // to compile
./a.exe                 // to run script

This script only generates sand cells.

Default settings will produce one matrix, with plain border and fill.

Randomize Fill will allow non-plain tiles to generated in inner matrix.
Noise amount determines the ratio of plain to non-plain tiles.
Iterations determines amount of matrices created by script.

Choose door locations.

output.txt is the file the matrices get stored in.
For now we will need to copy and paste this text into our tile#.json files.
