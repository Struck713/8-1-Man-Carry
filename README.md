This repository contains all of the code and information for [Dr. DeLozier's](https://www.kent.edu/cs/global-circ/dr-gregory-delozier-progressive-insurance) Software Engineering class at [Kent State University](https://www.kent.edu/). 

## Game Plan
We're going to build a 2D roguelike (like the [Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/)). If we abstract away the entire idea, it is quite simply:
- A maze
- A character stuck in that maze
- Some enemies (probably with some pathing and AI)
- A boss (or a couple of bosses)
- A story (??)
- An ending (??)
- music
- sound effects
- art

## Ideas 
**Theme**: Ocean

**Main character**: Nonapus

**Enemies**:
- Plants (standalone)
- Piranhas (or other small fish)
- Eels
- Stingrays
- Clams
- Crabs
- Boss
	- Human
	- Shark
	- The Kraken

**Buffs**:
- Health items
	- Small fish
    - Fish food
- Nuclear core (glow in the dark)
- Health buffs

**Room types**: (Perlin Noise for designating room type)
- Regular ocean
- Deep ocean
- Caves
- Shipwreck (loot room)
