We're going to build a 2D roguelike (like the [Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/)). If we abstract away the entire idea, it is quite simply:
- A maze
- A character stuck in that maze
- Some enemies (probably with some pathing and AI)
- A boss (or a couple of bosses)
- A story (??)
- An ending (??)

Our backup is going to be the original Dumb Ways to Die idea.
